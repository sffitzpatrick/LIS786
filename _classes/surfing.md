One of our most demanded classes, so spots will fill up as quick as a shark smells its prey! Our Shark Surfing classes take place in our state-of-the-art wave pool, specially designed for surfing. In our beginner level class, instructors will give you basic lessons on how to balance on your board, then move onto how to ride higher and stronger waves as you progress. Bring your own wetsuits or rent one from our inventory. Availability of sizes will vary the day of class, so you have the option of reserving one with registration.
