# About Us

## History
Starting in 2015, Surf Gym is the brain child of Mild Villains, Inc. We found ourselves daydreaming about getting active at the beach, despite our Midwest origins, so we decided to bring the beach to landlocked regions. Surf Gym is a creative concept gym that wants fitness to be fun and encouraging. Not only do we offer what traditional gyms have, we center our gyms around the theme of the ocean because there's no better place to be!

## Locations
Surf Gym has now expanded throughout North America, in more than 10 states and 28 locations. Find a Surf Gym near you!
